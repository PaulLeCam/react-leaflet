## v0.11.3 (2016-04-28)

Made the `draggable` property in `Marker` dynamic ([PR #148](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/148) by *riolowry*).

## v0.11.2 (2016-04-25)

Fixed layer removal in `LayersControl`.

## v0.11.1 (2016-04-17)

Fixed `map` property injection in `LayersControl` ([PR #142](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/142) by *Dahlgren*).

## v0.11.0 (2016-04-09)

- [BREAKING] Added `layerContainer` property as a consistent replacement for `map` or `layerGroup` ([PR #132](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/132) by *boromisp*). This is only breaking if you are creating custom components, as you will need to make sure to also inject the `layerContainer` property to children layers as you need to do with `map`.
- Changed `LayersControl` to be based on components:
  - Added `LayersControl.BaseLayer` container component to add a base layer to a `LayersControl`.
  - Added `LayersControl.Overlay` container component to add an overlay to a `LayersControl`.
  - `baseLayers` and `overlays` properties for `LayersControl` are still supported but deprecated. Using either of them will make the `LayersControl` behave the same way it does in versions < 0.11.
- Deprecated `onLeaflet...` properties for events, simply use `on...`, ex `onClick` instead of `onLeafletClick`.
- Added warnings for deprecated features, the same way React does. Make sure to address these warnings to ease the transition to future releases.
- Added React v15.0.0 support as peer dependency.
- [internal] Fixed `no-unused-vars` linting ([PR #131](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/131) by *boromisp*).

## v0.10.2 (2016-03-12)

- Added `animate` optional property to `Map` ([PR #126](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/126) by *mariusandra*).
- Added React v15.0.0-rc.1 support as peer dependency.

## v0.10.1 (2016-02-22)

- Added the popup container as source layer to `Popup` creation, fixes [#113](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/issues/113) ([PR #112](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/112) by *amarant*).
- [internal] Updated Lodash to v4.

## v0.10.0 (2015-12-22)

- Added `AttributionControl`, `LayersControl` and `ScaleControl` ([PR #100](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/100) by *jonboiser*).
- Added example to render a list of custom Markers ([PR #104](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/104) by *varya*).
- [internal] Updated Babel to v6.

## v0.9.0 (2015-11-12)

## v0.4.0-rc.1 (2015-03-11)

React v0.13.0.

## v0.4.0-beta.1 (2015-03-08)

- Updated React dependency to v0.13.0-rc2:
  - Components are defined as ES6 classes.
  - Mixins are replaced by the base components `MapComponent`, `MapLayer`, `BaseTileLayer` and `PopupContainer`. All components extend from these.
  - The new [`React.cloneElement()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/03/react-v0.13-rc2.html#react.cloneelement) API is used instead of the deprecated `React.addons.cloneWithProps()` to pass the `map` property to the components.
  - The `map` property has been removed from the components `propTypes` definition as it is dynamically injected to its children by the `Map` component, React would [now warn it is not set](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/24/streamlining-react-elements.html#solution-early-proptype-warnings). It is still required by components to have access to the Leaflet object.
- Events can now be set as `on{Event}` rather than `onLeaflet{Event}`, ex `onClick` instead of `onLeafletClick`, as all events are proxied to Leaflet.
- Deprecated `getLeafletElement()` method, simply use the `leafletElement` property instead to access the Leaflet object created for a component.
