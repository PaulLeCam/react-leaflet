- Replace Flow by TypeScript for type checking
- Drop IE support (Babel config will only target the "last 2 versions" of modern browsers)
- Switch to the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/)
- The `Map` component is replaced by [`MapContainer`](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/api-map#mapcontainer), behaving differently
- Event handlers must be attached using the [`eventHandlers prop`](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/api-components#evented-behavior) rather than `on*` props, with a similar change for [path options](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/api-components#path-behavior) and [WMS params](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/api-components#wmstilelayer)
- The `react-leaflet` package only exposes a [public API](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/api-map) while a new package, `@react-leaflet/core`, is used to provide the [core APIs](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/core-introduction)
