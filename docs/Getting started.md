# Getting started

## About React-Leaflet

This library provides an abstraction of [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) as [React components](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  
It does not replace Leaflet, only leverages [React's lifecycle methods](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#lifecycle-methods) to call the relevant Leaflet handlers. You can read more information about the lifecycle process in the [How it works](How%20it%20works.md) page of this documentation.
Please make sure you understand all the [core concepts](How%20it%20works.md#core-concepts) and [limitations](How%20it%20works.md#limitations) to evaluate if this library is appropriate for your needs.

React-Leaflet allows to convert this [sample code from Leaflet documentation](http://leafletjs.com/):

```js
import L from 'leaflet';

const position = [51.505, -0.09];
const map = L.map('map').setView(position, 13);

L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

L.marker(position).addTo(map)
  .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup. <br> Easily customizable.');
```

to React components:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Map, Marker, Popup, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet';

const position = [51.505, -0.09];
const map = (
  <Map center={position} zoom={13}>
    <TileLayer
      url='http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
      attribution='&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    />
    <Marker position={position}>
      <Popup>
        <span>A pretty CSS3 popup.<br/>Easily customizable.</span>
      </Popup>
    </Marker>
  </Map>
);

render(map, document.getElementById('map-container'));
```
Note that the `<Map>` component creates its own `<div>` container for the map, it does not get attached to an existing node.

You can run an example code using React-Leaflet in [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/paul_lecam/q2v7t59h/).

## Leaflet setup

If you are not familiar with Leaflet, make sure you read its [quick start guide](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html) before using this library.  
You will notably need to add its CSS to your page to render the map properly, and set the height of the `<Map>` container.

All components are React wrappers for Leaflet elements and layers, they need a map instance and therefore must be included in a top-level `<Map>` component.

## Installation

### Using npm

```bash
npm install react-leaflet
```

React, ReactDOM and Leaflet are peer dependencies, if you haven't already installed them you can use:

```bash
npm install leaflet react react-dom react-leaflet
```

### UMD

An UMD build is available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-leaflet/dist/react-leaflet.min.js"></script>
```

The library is injected as `window.ReactLeaflet`.
